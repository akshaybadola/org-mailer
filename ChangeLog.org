   - Added ~schedule~
   - As I seek to move away from unencrypted config file, regular mail fetching
     is now incorporated in ~mailer.py~ (renamed from ~gmailer.py~). The
     functionality seems to work fine.
   - Next would be to decouple this from the emacs package.

** [2022-09-24 Sat 18:43]
   - Changed behaviour of conversion of internal links so that it should only
     get paper links in ~org-mailer-convert-file-links-to-references~
   - Changed name of ~org-mailer-mail-subtree~ to ~org-mailer-compose~
   - ~org-mailer-compose~ will also mail region if active

** [2022-11-17 Thu 09:02]
   - Added reading plaintext offlineimap config file for mailer
   - Changes to ~org-mailer-install-py-deps~ and a possible fix to ~tmp-*~ files
     remaining after sending mail

** [2022-12-13 Tue 17:29]
   - Changed remaining ~gmailer~ references to ~mailer~
   - Fixed bug where temp file name in ~org-mailer-send-via-mailer~ was out of
     scope for the ~unwind-protect~

** [2023-01-19 Thu 08:31]
   - Fixed some excursion bug in mailer

** [2023-02-04 Sat 00:14]
   - In ~org-mailer-convert-file-links-to-references~, References in org-mailer
     are now inserted in a separate heading.
   - Added function ~org-mailer-export-buffer-or-subtree~ which runs
     ~org-mailer-mail-postprocess-hook~ before the body and text are returned.
     Required for doing org stuff in buffer and then removing stuff,
     e.g. drawers contain custom-ids which are used to generate links. After
     that only are they removed.
   - Added ~org-mailer-org-buffer-htmlize~ which actually calls
     ~org-mailer-export-buffer-or-subtree~

** [2023-04-24 Mon 12:23]
   - Bug fix for ~org-mailer-compose~ where repeated compose calls would throw
     errors for unresolved links because the file path was stripped from
     links already.

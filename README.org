* Org mailer

  Library to integrate org mode and mu4e with functions to optionally send mail
  with gmail

** Installation

   - For now you can clone the repo and add the directory to your `load-path`.
     Then `(require 'org-mailer)` will load the module.
   - You'll also need to install the requirements listed in the Cask file.

I'll try to upload to MELPA soon.

** Usage
   *TODO*
